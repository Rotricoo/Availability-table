# Availability Table

A customizable and interactive availability table for scheduling, campus management, or team planning.  
Easily manage, color, and annotate time slots for different locations or purposes.

## ðŸ“˜ Project Background

This project was originally inspired by a freeCodeCamp CSS variables challenge.  
Using the final result from that task, I decided to extend it into a fully interactive scheduling table â€” adding dynamic functionality, accessibility, and real-time customization.

  - Section 1: Theme Switching
  - Section 2: Cell Interaction
  - Section 3: LocalStorage
  - Section 4: Time Management
  - Section 5: Export
